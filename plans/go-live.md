# Go-live plan — refit repository

What is left in *this* repo before the docs can be published. The site-side work
is in [docs-site.md](docs-site.md); the two meet at step 5.

Written 2026-08-14. State at that point: `docs/` holds 17 pages, the workbench
serves them at `/docs`, `publish-docs.yml` is written but has never run, and no
release has been tagged.

---

## 1. Decide the published URL — blocks step 2

Four shapes were on the table:

- `onelegstudios.com/refit/docs`
- `onelegstudios.com/open-source/refit/docs`
- `open-source.onelegstudios.com/refit/docs`
- `refit.onelegstudios.com/docs`

All four work — `route.prefix` is passed straight to a Laravel route group, and
`route.domain` handles the subdomain forms.

Remember the version segment: with versioning on, a page lives at
`{prefix}/{version}/{slug}`, e.g. `/open-source/refit/docs/v0/guide/icons`.

- [ ] Pick one and write it here: `________________________`

## 2. Fix the cross-links to match

Every internal link in `docs/` is currently site-absolute against the `/docs`
prefix — `[Icons](/docs/guide/icons)`. There are 44 of them across the tree,
pointing at 15 distinct targets (README's links are relative `.md` paths and are
fine as they are; they serve GitHub, not the site).

All of them break the moment the prefix or the version segment changes.

Three ways to fix, in order of preference:

1. **Relative links** — `[Icons](../guide/icons)` from a page one level deep.
   Prefix- and version-independent, because the browser resolves them against
   the current URL. Costs: depth has to be right per page, and they no longer
   render as links on GitHub (they already don't, being absolute).
2. **Absolute with the final prefix** — simplest to read, but hardcodes both the
   prefix and the version, so every link needs rewriting again at v1.
3. **A Laradocs variable** — `Laradocs::share('base', '/open-source/refit/docs')`
   and `[Icons]({{ base }}/guide/icons)`. Prefix-independent, but the markdown
   stops being readable outside the site, and the value lives in the *site's*
   provider — a coupling in the wrong direction for a package repo.

- [ ] Choose an approach
- [ ] Rewrite the 44 links
- [ ] Re-run the link check (the loop used when the docs were written: extract
      every `(/docs…)` or relative target and assert a file exists for it)
- [ ] **Verify against a versioned layout**, not just the flat workbench — this
      is the step that actually proves the choice. See step 3.

> Relative-link resolution under a version segment is reasoned, not yet
> observed. Do not skip the verification.

## 3. Rehearse the published shape in the workbench

Today the workbench points Laradocs at `docs/` with the default `/docs` prefix
and no versioning — which is *not* the shape the site will serve.

- [ ] In `WorkbenchServiceProvider`, mirror the site: set `route.prefix` to the
      chosen path, `versions.enabled` to true, and point `docs.path` at a
      directory holding a `v0/` subdirectory rather than at `docs/` itself
      (symlink `v0 → ../docs`, or rsync into `build/docs-preview/v0`, so there
      is still one copy of the markdown to edit)
- [ ] `composer serve`, then click through every section, the version selector,
      and the search palette
- [ ] Confirm no link 404s and the sidebar highlights correctly
- [ ] Decide whether this rehearsal config stays (useful) or reverts to the
      simple flat setup once verified

## 4. Get the repo release-ready

- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` still has placeholders — `202x-xx-xx` and a `v0.1.0`
      compare link with an empty base. Fix both before the first tag
- [ ] `composer fixtures` then `composer test` — the feature suite is hollow
      without fixtures on disk
- [ ] `composer icons:check` and `composer flux:internals:check` — both report
      drift without writing
- [ ] Review `git diff` on `resources/` if either check wrote anything
- [ ] Tag and publish `v0.1.0` from GitHub (the publish workflow fires on
      `released`, so a draft or pre-release does nothing)

## 5. Turn on publishing — needs the site repo to exist

- [ ] Create the token with `contents: write` on the site repository
- [ ] Set `secrets.DOCS_SITE_TOKEN`, `vars.DOCS_SITE_REPO`, and
      `vars.DOCS_SITE_PATH` if it differs from `docs-sources/refit`
- [ ] Run `publish-docs.yml` via `workflow_dispatch` **before** relying on a
      release to fire it — the workflow has never executed
- [ ] Confirm the commit lands in the site repo at `docs-sources/refit/v0/`,
      with `_version.json` carrying the exact tag
- [ ] Confirm the site rebuilds and serves the new pages

## Decisions already made

- Docs are delivered by **push from this repo**, not by the site requiring the
  package. Composer installs one version at a time, so composer-require cannot
  serve v1 and v2 side by side.
- **One directory per major.** All of `0.x` is `v0`; pre-release tags are
  refused so a beta cannot overwrite a stable line.
- The version selector shows the **exact tag** of the latest release in each
  line (`v0.2.1`), refreshed on every publish.
- `docs/` and `plans/` are `export-ignore`d, so the Composer dist stays lean.
  The publisher reads the git repo, not the dist, so this costs nothing.
